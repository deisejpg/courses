This is a collection of online or in-person courses that I've taken over the years.
I will keep adding courses as I have time to review the code of course I took in the
past and time to complete the courses I am currently taking. Right now I am 
self-teaching data analyses for health care and precision medicine, sql and sqlalchemy,
and flask.
More soon!
