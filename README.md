__2025 update__  
__The last couple of years had been the best of my life!__   
I landed a job in industry, got married, and started a family! While I was gaining  
experience at my first industry job and enjoying the new world of parenthood, I didn't  
have much time to take/complete courses and went on a learn-on-the-fly long ride.  

Coming from working for years in a Linux environment and using TACC Lonestar5 and  
Stampede supercomputers, I had to quickly pick up Windows Powershell scripting and go  
from using R all the time and Python for some specific tasks, to full-time Python coding.  

I am amazed by all that I have learned in industry! A mix of collaborative and   
independent work with creativity and the desire to go beyond expectations has been  
a great way to keep learning every day!  

As an enthusiastic student, I am hoping to take a few courses this year. Some to refresh  
concepts and tools and some to expand my knowledge about cancer biology. Right now I am doing  
the __Machine Learning Specialization__ on Coursera by Andrew Ng from Deep Learning AI. I am also  
exploring the series of courses by Terezija Semenski on __Machine learning Foundations__ which  
is being a great review of calculus, stats, probability, and linear algebra. I took  
the Kaggle __5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course__ last last year, but I am still reviewing the code.  
I will update the content from these courses soon with user-friendly documentation to make  
future consultations to the material easy and to potentially help others to get learning!



  
__2022__  
This is a collection of online and in-person courses I've taken over the years.  
I will keep adding courses as I have time to review the code of courses taken  
in the past and time to complete new courses.  
Right now I am learning data analyses for health care and precision medicine,  
sql and sqlalchemy, and flask.
